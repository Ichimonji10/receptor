Receptor
========

Receptor is a mesh network that connects services that have work to do with other 
nodes that can perform the work, typically because that work needs to be done closer
to the target of the work which might not be directly accessible to the systems
producing the work. It's intended to be used on any type of network topology across data
centers and clouds, especially when passing between zones that might have
different ingress patterns and security policies.
