    This may not be reliable at all due to an inherent race condition. This works
    by creating a socket on an ephemeral port, inspecting it to see what port was used,
    closing it, and returning that port number. In the time between closing the socket
    and opening a new one, it's possible for the OS to reopen that port for another purpose.

    In practical testing, this race condition did not result in a failure to (re)open the
    returned port number, making this solution squarely "good enough for now".
